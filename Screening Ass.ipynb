    "Answer :\n",
    "\n",
    "        1) Abstract Class : An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class.By default, Python does not provide abstract classes. Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC. The ABC class defines the behavior of other classes. Abstract class can have abstract methode and concrete methodes.The object of abstract class cannot be created.\n",
    "        Example >> To create abstract class\n",
    "                   \n",
    "                   from abc import ABC,abstractmethode\n",

    "                    \n",
    "        Abstract methode - An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation. Abstract method is a methode whose action is redefined in the child classes of that methode as per the object reqirement. We can declare a method as an abstract method by using @abstractmethode decorator. We use the abstract class when there are some common features shared by all the objects as they are.\n",
    "        Example >> To create an abstract method in abstract class\n",

    "         An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation. While we are designing large functional units we use an abstract class. When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component, we use an abstract class. By default, Python does not provide abstract classes. Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC. ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base. A method becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod."
